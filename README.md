# ExtendedSwift

Things that should¹ be in Swift, but aren't.

Because anything worth doing is worth over-doing.

## Disclaimer

This is a repository of things I have found useful while writing apps and packages for myself. 

You should not include this project in your own code. Instead, use it as an example of how I approach problems and a possible way that you might solve the same problem.

¹ - By "should", I mean "At some point in the past, I found this useful enough to pull out into its own thing."
